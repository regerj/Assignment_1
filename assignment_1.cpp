// Hey Ava, I know we have already talked about creating individual functions, but for this first assignment we can
// just do everything in main for simplicity. It is good coding practice to seperate blocks of code into their own
// functions, but for this first program it's alright to do it all in main. I've layed out the steps one by one of
// how I would approach the problem, but you are free to do it in whatever order you feel makes the most sense.
// You don't need to follow this format. Lemme know if you have any questions :)

int main()
{
    // 1. Gather user input

    // 2. Cacluate annual salary

    // 3. Calculate commission from car sales (hint: remember to use rand() to get a random number for average profit %)

    // 4. Calculate loss from misconducts (hint: use pow() to calculate doubling loss per misconduct)

    // 5. Calculate gross income

    // 6. Calculate taxes owed based on gross income, state, and year

    // 7. Display the gross income, taxes owed, and net income
